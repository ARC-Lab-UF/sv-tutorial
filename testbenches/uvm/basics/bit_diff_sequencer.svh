// A UVM sequencer is responsible for managing the flow of sequence items from 
// potentially multiple sequences into a driver. It provides mechanisms to 
// control and manage the execution of these sequences.
//
// Sequencers can become quite complex when dealing with intricate interfaces 
// that require specific timings for sequence items, which may be of different 
// types.
    
// Fortunately, in many cases, when youâ€™re feeding a single type of sequence to
// a driver, the uvm_sequencer class already provides all the necessary 
// functionality. This is why, in this example, the sequencer extends the 
// uvm_sequencer class without adding any additional functionality.
